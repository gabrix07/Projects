# Speaker Recognition

The aim of this project is to create system that should recognize the speaker by using voice data. This system could classify different speakers through artificial neural network. The neural network was trained by unsupervised learning, in addition to simulate
an analogous neural network, which was formed by memristors, resistances and electric capacitors.
