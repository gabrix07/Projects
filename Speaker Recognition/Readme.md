# Speaker Recognition

The aim of this project is to create system that should recognize the speaker by using voice data. This system could classify different speakers through artificial neural network. The neural network was trained by unsupervised learning, in addition to simulate
an analogous neural network, which was formed by memristors, resistances and electric capacitors.This classification method was analysed and finally compared to other methods commonly used in
speaker recognition:

* Vector quantization
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Neural Network (superviced learning)
